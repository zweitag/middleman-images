Feature: Building images

  Scenario: Building all images
    Given a fixture app "image"
    And a file named "config.rb" with:
      """
      activate :images
      """
    And a template named "index.html.erb" with:
      """
      <%= image_tag 'images/fox.jpg', optimize: true %>
      <%= image_tag 'images/fox.jpg', resize: '400x225', optimize: true %>
      <%= image_tag 'images/fox.jpg', resize: '400x225', optimize: false %>
      """
    And a successfully built app at "image"
    When I cd to "build"
    Then the following files should exist:
      | index.html |
      | images/fox.jpg |
      | images/fox-opt.jpg |
      | images/fox-400x225.jpg |
      | images/fox-400x225-opt.jpg |

  Scenario: Not rebuilding existing resources
    Given a fixture app "image"
    And "images" feature is "enabled"
    And a template named "first.html.erb" with:
      """
      <%= image_tag 'images/fox.jpg', optimize: true %>
      """
    And a template named "second.html.erb" with:
      """
      <%= image_tag 'images/fox.jpg', optimize: true %>
      """
    And the Server is running
    And I go to "/first.html"
    And a modification time for a file named "/source/images/fox-opt.jpg"
    When I go to "/second.html"
    Then the file "/source/images/fox-opt.jpg" should not have been updated
