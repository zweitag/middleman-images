  Scenario: Building all images

      """
      <%= image_tag 'images/fox.jpg', optimize: true %>
      <%= image_tag 'images/fox.jpg', resize: '400x225', optimize: true %>
      <%= image_tag 'images/fox.jpg', resize: '400x225', optimize: false %>
      """
    And a successfully built app at "image"
    When I cd to "build"
    Then the following files should exist:
      | index.html |
      | images/fox.jpg |
      | images/fox-opt.jpg |
      | images/fox-400x225.jpg |

      """
    And a template named "second.html.erb" with:
      """
      <%= image_tag 'images/fox.jpg', optimize: true %>
      """
    And the Server is running
    And I go to "/first.html"
    And a modification time for a file named "/cache/images/fox-opt.jpg"
    When I go to "/second.html"
